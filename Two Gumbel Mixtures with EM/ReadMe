% We are given the following scenario
% g=alpha*f1+(1-alpha)*f2
% h=beta*f1+(1-beta)*f2
% We are given two sets of data and one is from g with n1 data and the other is from h with n2 data
% f1 and f2 are Gumbel distributions
% Now we want to use EM to find the proportions as well as the distributions

% The following is the outline of this algorithm
% 1. Initialize the classifiers for each x, e.g. K-mean
% repeat the following:
% 2. For 1st dataset apply the Expectation step
% 3. For 1st dataset apply M-step
% 4. For 2nd dataset apply E-step
% 5. For 2nd dataset apply M-step

% Alternative outline of this algorithm
% 1. Initialization of the membership
% repeat:
% 2. Apply E-step for two datasets independently
% 3. Apply M-step to the combined dataset
